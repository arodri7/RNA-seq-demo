# RNA-seq-demo
Galaxy based RNA-seq workflow from data transfer to gene expression and Functional Gene Enrichment annotations (FGSEA)

This tutorial will help you submit a sample RNA-seq workflow using the [Pilot GlobusGenomics instance](https://pilot1.globusgenomics.org).

## DATA
The sample workflow uses data from [Bioproject PRJNA378660](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA378660). It is composed of 9 samples (5 control, 4 cases). The input files are compressed fastq files and they have previously been uploaded to our instance to prevent additional data upload to the instance. Typically, the user could use the EBI SRA upload tool by indicating the bioproject accession number to get the data.
